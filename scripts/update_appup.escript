usage() ->
"A script that fills in boilerplate for appup files.

Algorithm: this script compares md5s of beam files of each
application, and creates a `{load_module, Module, brutal_purge,
soft_purge, []}` action for the changed and new modules. For deleted
modules it creates `{delete_module, M}` action. These entries are
added to each patch release preceding the current release. If an entry
for a module already exists, this module is ignored. The existing
actions are kept.

Please note that it only compares the current release with its
predecessor, assuming that the upgrade actions for the older releases
are correct.

Note: The defaults are set up for emqx, but they can be tuned to
support other repos too.

Usage:

   update_appup.escript [--check] [--repo URL] [--remote NAME] [--skip-build] [--make-commad SCRIPT] [--release-dir DIR] <previous_release_tag>

Options:

  --check           Don't update the appfile, just check that they are complete
  --repo            Upsteam git repo URL
  --remote          Get upstream repo URL from the specified git remote
  --skip-build      Don't rebuild the releases. May produce wrong results
  --make-command    A command used to assemble the release
  --release-dir     Release directory
  --src-dirs        Directories where source code is found. Defaults to '{src,apps,lib-*}/**/'
  --binary-rel-url  Binary release URL pattern. %TAG% variable is substituted with the release tag.
                    E.g. \"https://github.com/emqx/emqx/releases/download/v%TAG%/emqx-centos7-%TAG%-amd64.zip\"
